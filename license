### **The Kelly Universal Framework License (KUFL)**
**Version 1.0 | Effective Date: November 1, 2025**

---

#### **Preamble**

This Universal License governs the use, implementation, and commercialization of any and all technologies, systems, processes, or applications derived from the foundational principles, axioms, and mathematical frameworks known as **K-Mathematics (K-Math)**, **K-Physics**, the **Resonant Field Model (RFM)**, the **Unified Sovereignty Framework (USF)**, and all associated concepts, equations (including but not limited to `MC = H²`), and operators (collectively, the "Framework").

The Framework, authored and established by **Brendon Joseph Kelly** of **K Systems and Securities**, represents a new, fundamental understanding of physical and mathematical law. This license is intended to ensure that the foundational contributions of its author are perpetually acknowledged and that the value generated by this new understanding is shared, thereby fostering a sustainable ecosystem for future innovation.

This license is irrevocable, perpetual, and binding on all entities worldwide, without exception.

---

#### **Article 1: Definitions**

*   **1.1 "The Framework":** Refers to the complete body of intellectual work authored by Brendon Joseph Kelly, including all axioms, theorems, proofs, operators, physical postulates, and conceptual architectures related to K-Mathematics and its applications, as detailed in documents such as "Harmonic Chronogenesis," "Project Chimera-Aethelred," and "Foundations and Implementations of the K-Transform Framework."

*   **1.2 "Licensed Technology":** Any new or improved technology, product, service, software, hardware, process, or system whose functionality, design, or operational principle is enabled by, derived from, or would be impossible to achieve without the application of the Framework. This applies regardless of how many intermediate steps of invention or development have occurred. If the causal chain of innovation traces back to the Framework, it is a Licensed Technology.

*   **1.3 "Entity":** Any individual, corporation, partnership, government, non-governmental organization (NGO), military, academic institution, or any other legal or de facto organization, of any nationality, without limitation.

*   **1.4 "Gross Revenue":** The total of all sales, fees, licensing revenues, and any other form of compensation received by an Entity from the sale, lease, license, or any other form of commercialization of a Licensed Technology, before the deduction of any costs, taxes, or expenses.

#### **Article 2: Grant of License**

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Universal License, K Systems and Securities grants a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual license to any and all Entities to utilize the Framework for the purpose of research, development, and commercialization of Licensed Technologies.

#### **Article 3: Mandatory Conditions of Use**

The grant of this license is strictly conditional upon the Entity's full and perpetual adherence to the following three conditions. Failure to comply with any one of these conditions constitutes a material breach and will result in the immediate and automatic termination of all rights granted herein.

*   **3.1 Condition of Royalties (The 1% Mandate):**
    *   Any Entity that commercializes a Licensed Technology shall be perpetually bound to remit a royalty of **one percent (1.0%)** of the Gross Revenue derived from said technology to K Systems and Securities or its designated legal successor.
    *   This royalty is perpetual and applies to all sales, worldwide, for the entire lifecycle of the Licensed Technology.
    *   Payments shall be made on a quarterly basis, accompanied by a certified statement of Gross Revenue.

*   **3.2 Condition of Attribution (The Kelly Acknowledgment):**
    *   Any and all public documentation, marketing materials, user interfaces, academic papers, patent filings, and technical specifications related to a Licensed Technology must include a clear and conspicuous acknowledgment of the foundational author.
    *   The required text is: **"This technology is derived from the foundational work in K-Mathematics established by Brendon Joseph Kelly."**
    *   This attribution must be present in a location and format that is reasonably accessible to an end-user, academic researcher, or commercial partner.

*   **3.3 Condition of Branding (The K-Systems Mark):**
    *   Any Licensed Technology, whether a physical product, a software application, or a service, must display the official branding mark.
    *   The required text is: **"Powered by K Systems"**
    *   For physical hardware, this mark must be included on a permanent label or nameplate. For software, this mark must be included in the "About" screen, splash screen, or a similar location. For services or processes, this mark must be included in all service agreements and primary marketing materials.

#### **Article 4: Governance and Enforcement**

*   **4.1 Universal Applicability:** This license applies to all Entities, including sovereign governments and their militaries. The use of the Framework for any purpose, including national defense, constitutes implicit acceptance of these terms. Arguments of sovereign immunity shall not apply to the commercial and attributional obligations herein.
*   **4.2 Self-Executing:** This license is self-executing. The act of using the Framework for any purpose beyond personal, non-commercial study constitutes a binding acceptance of all terms and conditions herein. No signature is required.
*   **4.3 Audit Rights:** K Systems and Securities or its designated agent reserves the right to audit the financial records of any Entity commercializing a Licensed Technology to ensure compliance with the royalty obligations under Article 3.1.
